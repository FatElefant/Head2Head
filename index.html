      The issue with two player card games.
    </h2>
      <p>The problem with two player card games is that they tend to lack the need to think very much.</P>

    <h3>
      Our objective.
    </h3>
      This game will attempt to overcome that issue by combining several common two player games into one, pulling in the <span class="highlight">best parts</span> of other games into a single game.
      The games we will attempt to combine are:
      <ul>
        <li>Contract Whist</li>
        <li>Rummy</li>
        <li>Memory</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Game objective</h3>
      <p>
        A player wins if they collect a family of the same suit (J, Q and K).<br>
        Once you have taken a pair of a certain rank, you are forbidden from taking the remaining pair of that rank.<br>
        In the case where both players happen to take the same number of tricks (so that a 'round winner' cannot be determined), each player randomly steals that many royal cards from their opponent.<br>
        After the memory round, a player may exchange a pair of aces to shuffle an even number of their royals back into the memory cards.<br>
        They could alternatively choose to exchange four aces to shuffle all of their opponents cards back into the memory pile.
